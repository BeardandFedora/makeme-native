# Transforms

A common pattern when working with APIs is to change data to play nice between the app & the API.  

Transforms are not necessarily a bad thing (although an API might have us transforming more than we'd like).

For example, we may:

* turn appropriate strings to date objects
* convert snake case to camel case
* normalize or denormalize things
* create lookup tables
